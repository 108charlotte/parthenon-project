: As you continue your journey, you notice the gate is guarded by a large dog... with multiple heads? 
Cerberus: Intruder. Trespasser. Singer? …Maybe?
- Soothe Cerberus with a song
	: You open Spotify and start a calming playlist.
	Cerberus: Warm… safe… music… IS THAT CLAIRO?
	: His middle head begins to droop. "Performative ahh male," exclaims the left head.
	: Seems like you can safely pass through this area.
	Cerberus: ...
	Cerberus: Wait. What happened to the music?
	: You have reached an unskippable ad.
	- Buy Spotify premium
		: Oh shoot. You forgot how broke you are.
		: You frantically search your brain for a solution, and then it comes to you: HCB.
		- Use HCB card
			: You pull out your recent HCB "emergency" grant, and pay for spotify premium.
			: The music resumes.
			Cerberus: *drifts off to sleep*
			You: That was a close call...
			do GlobalVariables.passed_m1 = true
		- Use face card
			: You are Hippolyta, Amazonian Queen. Your face card never declines.
			: The music resumes.
			Cerberus: *drifts off to sleep*
			You: That was a close call...
		do GlobalVariables.passed_m1 = true
	- Run for your life
		: All of Cerberus' heads perk up. His tail starts wagging.
		Cerberus: Are we playing catch?!
		You: Yes! Good idea!
		: Cerberus leaps into the air, pouncing on the target.
		: You were the target. You have died.
		do GlobalVariables.failed_game()
	- Wait out the ad
		: Just as Cerberus starts growling, the music resumes.
		You: That was a close call...
		do GlobalVariables.passed_m1 = true
- Distract one of his heads
	You: Hey, you! Fetch!
	: You throw a tennis ball. \n You forget that tennis balls do not exist in the World of Starfall.
	Cerberus: There is nothing to fetch! Deception is unwise. Face my wrath!
	: He lunges. You are fast, but not fast enough.

# Parthenon Project! 
We built this game due to our inspiration of Athena and Greek mythology -- all of us are Percy Jackson nerds!

The main premise is that the world is at stake; a star has fallen from the sky and fragmented, and the rest of the world is soon to follow. Navigate your way through an extensive, murky maze filled with monsters, including Medusa, from the Underworld, and make correct decisions to get your fragmented stars back and escape the maze! 

One issue we ran into that we were able to resolve through version control was through a lot of broken commits. This occurred because we ony later realized that our Godot versions were different, but version control helped us save the working code and revamp what was broken. We also handled problems in scope and had to cut out a lot of aspects, but we will definitely expand on this project in the future!

All of our art assets are original and hand-drawn during the time of this jam!

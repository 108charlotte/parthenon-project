# Parthenon Project! 
We built this game due to our inspiration from the Athena Award and Greek mythology -- all of us are Percy Jackson nerds!

The main premise is that the world is at stake; a great star has fallen from the sky and fragmented, and the rest of the world is soon to follow. The gates of the underworld have been opened, and monsters are rampant in the overworld. Navigate your way through an extensive, murky labyrinth filled with monsters, including Medusa, Cerberus, and Arachne. Make correct choices when encountering these monsters to gather the fragments and piece together the great star! 

One issue we ran into that we were able to resolve through version control was through a lot of broken commits. This occurred because we ony later realized that our Godot versions were different, but version control helped us save the working code and revamp what was broken. We also handled problems in scope and had to cut out a lot of aspects, but we will definitely expand on this project in the future!

All of our art assets are original and hand-drawn during the time of this jam!
